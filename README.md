# COSC51-ProjectsSM

The attached files are my coding projects for my COSC51 class using C++. 

The background for the projects is that we are helping Habitat for Humanity figure out calculations of materials to build houses.

The materials calculator takes as input the measurements of a single room and calculates the amount, weight, and cost of drywall and flooring needed for the room.

The house materials calculator takes as input a file name with room measurements and calculates the amount, weight, and cost of drywall and flooring needed for each room and for the entire house.
